# Blockchain-CV

Application that allows you to generate your CV and store it on a Blockchain.
It connects with a smart contract that dynamically stores CV information on a Blockchain.
The frontend uses jQuery and the library web3 to call the methods of the smart contract to store or get information.

The smart contract was deployed on a private blockchain using Ganache, which was stored on a AWS EC2 instance.
Metamask was used to access the wallets generated by ganache, and to connect the website to the Blockchain.
The web server was available at the same EC2 instance running on apache.
